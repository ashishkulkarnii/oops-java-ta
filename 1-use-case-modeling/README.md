## Lab 1: Use-case Modeling

### Problem Statement

Draw a use-case model to describe the interactions between a retail investor, stockbroker and stock exchange. An investor logs in to their demat account (or signs up) with their stockbroker, and can place buy or sell orders (at a certain price) on any number of shares of any company listed on the stock exchange. The order is given to the stock exchange via the broker, provided the user has sufficient balance in their trading account. It is important to note that the orders can only be placed during market trading hours.
